        <p>We understand that the issues our clients face when they have been injured
          due to the negligence of others. Every case is unique and that each case
          requires different skills and approaches. A personal injury of any kind
          can be an extremely traumatic event when you or family member is injured
          due to the negligence of others. From the initial shock of the accident
          to the reality of living with the injuries sustained, accidents and negligent
          events resulting in serious personal injury can present one of life’s most
          stressful challenges. When you add the stress that comes from dealing with
          medical providers and insurance coverage, it is easy to see why experienced
          and effective personal injury attorneys are needed to obtain full compensation
          with any personal injury claim. Scheveck Law Firm is here to help if you
          have been injured or a loved one has been killed due to any of the following:</p>

        <p>We have experience in the field of personal injury litigation, and we regularly
          try cases throughout Montana as well as in neighboring jurisdictions. If
          you have been injured due to the negligence of others, it is important
          that you contact an attorney right away. Most claims for negligence must
          be brought within a specific time period or your claim will be forever
          barred. Call the experienced attorneys at the Scheveck Law Firm to schedule

        <br>
        <p>The Scheveck Law Firm is a small group of highly qualified attorneys who
          advocate for men’s rights in divorces, child custody and parenting plans,
          paternity, support, property settlement, modifications, and other family
          law matters. We all need strategic guidance and professional decision making
          in difficult times. The issues of husbands and fathers are part of an equation
          that demands recognition from the courts, as well as from other lawyers,
          wives, mothers, children, and all who are affected by family law issues.
          Our clients benefit from compassionate, skilled, family law attorneys who
          have experienced countless successful mediations and trials.
        </p>

        <p>When resolving family law disputes, gender shouldn't matter. Men and women
          should be treated fairly and equally. Unfortunately, in civil and criminal
          matters, particularly in cases involving divorce or custody, men often
          know the cards are stacked against them from the outset. At the Scheveck
          Law Firm, we work hard to protect the rights and interests of our clients.
          The attorneys provide experienced legal advice, strong advocacy and aggressive
          court representation for our clients who are preparing for divorce or dealing
          with other family law or criminal allegations.</p>

        <p>Our approach is to listen, return calls promptly, keep our clients prepared
          and informed. We understand our clients priorities and concerns. All the
          attorneys are products from single-family homes and while we cannot promise
          specific results, as a client, you can expect a professional service tailored
          to your unique family law situation. The Scheveck Law Firm understands
          that people live on a limited income. We have payment options and programs
          for families. Call the Scheveck Law Firm to schedule a free consultation
          with a family law attorney who is experienced, qualified, and understanding
          of the male perspective today.

        <p>If you are under investigation for criminal activity or have been charged
          with a crime or violation of traffic laws, then you need an attorney with
          extensive experience handling these matters who can provide you with effective
          representation and counseling. There are several reasons one may be charged
          with a crime including mistaken identity, false accusations, lack of restraint,
          poor judgment, or feeling that one had no other choice but to commit certain
          actions. The Scheveck Law Firm criminal defense attorneys have experience
          providing aggressive representation, who have been charged with crimes
          ranging from simple misdemeanors to serious felonies in both state and
          federal court, throughout Montana and neighboring jurisdictions. If you
          or a loved one is facing criminal charges, it is important to consult with
          our lawyers who have experience handling cases from domestic violence all
          the way up to rape. Our team has seen it all, and tried it all with success.
