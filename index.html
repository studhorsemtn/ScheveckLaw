          <p>Layne Scheveck's passion for family law began early in his career as a
            student at Dakota Wesleyan University, where he interned at MorganTheeler
            PLLC, taking an interest in family law. During his legal studies at Cooley
            Law School, Layne concentrated his time with seminars in family law.

            Defender's Office and as a private attorney, where he represented defendants
            from simple assaults to the most serious felonies. Layne specializes
            in family law, criminal law, and personal injury in motorcycle accidents.

          <p>Prior to attending law school, Layne earned his BA in Business with an
            emphasis on accounting.</p>
          <p>Layne is very happy to be back in his home town. When he is not working

            offer.
