                        certificate in natural resources. </p>

                        to practice in the United States District Court of Montana.</p>

                    <p>Layne Scheveck's passion for family law began early in his career as a student at Dakota Wesleyan University, where he interned at MorganTheeler PLLC, taking an interest in family law. During his legal studies at Cooley Law School,
                        Layne concentrated his time with seminars in family law. Prior to starting Scheveck Law Firm, Layne worked at the Montana Public Defender's Office and as a private attorney, where he represented defendants from simple assaults
                        to the most serious felonies. Layne specializes in family law, criminal law, and personal injury in motorcycle accidents. </p>
                    <p>Prior to attending law school, Layne earned his BA in Business with an emphasis on accounting.</p>
